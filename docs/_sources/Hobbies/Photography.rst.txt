Photography

.. important::

   I consider myself a landscape photography amateur. I used to have my own camera (Nikon P7100), but now I can only shoot with my cellphone here. The good thing is that for ordinary landscapes, today's cellphones are capable enough to shoot.

My father has always been a heavy camera user, and my mother has always been very keen on appearing in photographs as the main character. As a result, my photography hobby has been influenced by my family to a greater or lesser extent. However, my father always shot portraits, while I prefer to shoot landscapes.

It wasn't until I was pursuing my BS degree in Shanghai that I actually had my first camera by my side that was always with me. It is a Nikon Coolpix P7100, a 10.1 million pixel digital camera with a fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.8-5.6 28-200mm lens.

Later, my father got a standard DSLR, Nikon D5200, but I didn't play with that camera much. After around 7 years, he updated it to Nikon D780. In fact I still think the mirrorless Nikon Z 6â…¡ is slightly better in focus and future lenses/firmware supports, but for him DSLR's longer battery life and cheaper large-aperture lens options are much more important.

I didn't bring my camera with me oversea, so I can only show you some photos taken by my cellphones (shot on Google Pixel 5A, image pixels are compressed):
