Hobbies
=============

I consider myself to be a person with a relatively wide range of hobbies. However, some of my hobbies are indeed somewhat niche. 

My hobbies include (but are not limited to):

* :doc:`Computer Programming </Hobbies/Programming>`: I use Python/R, HTML/JS, C\#, and more. I have published a book for using LaTeX (if it counts as a programming language).

* :doc:`Rubik-cube`: I am 3x3 cuber with a single best of 13.81 seconds, but it is not recorded by a camera. Here is a video for the fast solve that I have ever recorded.

  Below is a representative sample of my tone tuning work, singing One Night in Beijing (北京一夜). The virtual singer voice library is distrubted by the famous Chinese voice actor Ge Ping (葛平).
