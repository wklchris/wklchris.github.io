Why do I write?
---------------------

I believe that **technical sharing** is one of the best way to make our lives better. We have invented so many new technologies and used them to produce so many products that can serve the public. Unfortunately, many of these products are great, but they may require a certain technical threshold to use. Thus, without someone sharing a short and clear tutorial, many non-technical people (or even technical people without relevant experiences) miss out on softwares or products that could have benefited them.

Many years ago we emphasized the *spirit of the Internet*, in which "sharing" was an important part. We use Internet search engines every day to access and benefit from information that others have shared. I think we should be grateful for that and give back as much as we can.

So I hope that my techincal sharing blogs can help someone else, even if I don't know who that person is or where they are from, and even if we will never meet or chat in our lifetime. But at the moment someone reads my blog, we both know that the sharing spirit of the Internet is somehow wonderfully connecting two people on this planet, and making us understand that the Internet *has*, *is*, and *will* change everyone through a similar way.
