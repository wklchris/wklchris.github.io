About Me
===============

.. note::

   This page is **NOT** a resume. It introduces myself in more detail in a *casual* tone.


Self-portrait
-----------------

* Born Nov 1994 in Hubei, China.
* Male. Straight. Single. 
* Having no religion belief. 
* Being slightly introverted. Feel good at spending time alone or with a small group of people.
* Never taking naps in the afternoon.
* Always proclaim self as a cat person, though it doesn't means that I don't like dogs. My family told me that I loved holding and rubbing cats and dogs on the home floor at the age when I was learning to walk. They said I prefered dogs at that age, but you know, things have definitely changed.
* Eating light-tasting diet, though accept slight spicy flavor. Like hotpot and tangerines. Dislike greasy/high-fat meat and celery. Stay neutral on ginger and cilantro.
* A geek. I write codes for many years. I care about hardwares, their specs and performances. I also watch new digital products previews and, just like most geeks, clearly know that I don't have that much money to buy them back.
* A fast learner, or at least a person with the so-called *research spirit*. I am interested in playing around with new things and learning new skills. 


Anecdotes
---------------

* *Family*: I have the world's most gentle mom, a dad who is old-fashioned but always have something to talk about on technical topics, a grandma who always worry about all the trivial things, a grandpa who sometimes loses temper but actually dotes on me a lot, and a two-day younger male cousin who I can talk everything with. I love them forever.
* *Pets*: From the age I can remember, I have always had many cats and dogs around my home. Yes I know you're jealous, but I was really a kid having *both* cat and dog.
* *Nickname*: My nickname was shouted from middle school to high school to college, and it never changed. Some of my friends think it's "cave" (洞), some think it's "freezing" (冻). Anyway, in Chinese the two are pronounced the same, so whatever they think.
* When I was in elementary school, I loved to go downstairs to the bookstore and read the "Old Man" (老夫子) comics, and the owner of the bookstore knew me well (probably because I never bought one).
* I was a soccer and ping-pong fan in elementary school, and when I got to middle school soccer turned into going to basketball games with my cousin every week. By the time I got to high school, I had a tablemate who really liked to play soccer, and I ended up throwing away the basketball to play soccer again. Ping-pong is probably the only ball hobby that has remained constant for me, but for now I don't play it much anymore.
* I didn't really start listening to pop songs until I was almost out of middle school. Even though I had purchased `S.H.E.`_'s albums in elementary school (around 2006), I just thought it was cool to be able to play CDs at home at the time. I can hardly believe now that I only started listening to `Jay Chou`_ as late as 2008.
* I got into my high school with the 45th highest ranking in the city, so I was somehow smug. Given my grades in my freshman and sophomore years of high school, I could only say that I had hopes of going to an in-province university. But in my senior year because of my two friends, my personality underwent a big change. I became calm (or more introverted, as some friends said) and focused on studying, then my grades took a leap, and finally my entrance exam results allowed me to go to university in Shanghai.
* The first TV series I ever watched seriously was *Chinese Paladin 3* (仙剑奇侠传3) (BTW, this official translation is really awful), which I watched during many self-study sessions in the high school.
* The first online literature I finished reading in its entirety was *Jade Dynasty* (诛仙) (Can someone explain why they translated it that way?). My high school classmate bought the series, and I borrow each volume from him and finish reading the whole story. No, not the self-study sessions, I used the lunch breaks this time.
* During my undergraduate years, I traveled to several places with my roommates and used my camera carefully for photography. Without him, I probably would not have left so many photos documenting my memories, so I am very grateful to him.
* In 2017, I went hiking for the first time with my friends and the location was the Pinnacles National Park. I bought a pair of hiking shoes after I got home, but our group of friends never hiked again.
* I transferred from MS to PhD program in 2019. A lot of things happened that year. I returned home over the summer and found that many things had changed. I had to learn to say goodbye to the warm memories and old times.
* I published my own book in 2020. I myself was very astonished: as a PhD student, I never thought that the first publication of my life would be a book rather than an academic paper.
* I reached a new achievement in 2021, which was hospitalization. I have not been hospitalized for as long as I can remember, let alone overseas. Due to winter break and some other reasons, I was pretty much unvisited during my one-week hospitalization, but miraculously I stayed in a pretty good mood. I have no doubt that I've gotten tougher.
