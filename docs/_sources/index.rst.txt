My name is Kanglong Wu, or you can call me by my internet nickname ``wklchris``.

I got my BS degree in Transportation Engineering (with a Mathematics minor) in `Tongji University`_ in Shanghai, China. Now I am a PhD student in Transportation Engineering program of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of California, Davis (`UC Davis`_). 

Although I don't major in computer science, I have been learning programming since I was 10 years old and have always loved it. This is the reason why I am active on Github and have created this personal site.


Sub-sites
-------------------

Here is the list of sub-sites of this personal Github.io domain:

* **Blog**: You may visit the *Blogs* page (from the sidebar or topbar) for details.
* **Simrofy**: This website is built on a Sphinx theme that I developed in my spare time, called "Simrofy". You can access its documentation by visiting the Simrofy_ sub-site. The source code (Github repo) is available at `wklchris/sphinx-simrofy-theme`_.
