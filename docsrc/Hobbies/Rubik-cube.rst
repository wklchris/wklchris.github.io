Magic Cube
------------------

.. important::
   
   My personal best was to achieve an average of around 16 seconds for five restores of the 3rd-order (3x3) magic cube. Although I haven't practiced for a long time, I think I still can achieve around 25 sec now.

   I used to be able to recover a 4th-order magic cube, though at a relatively slow level (about 2.5 minutes). Now I have forgotten the most difficult edge-exchanging formula.

I am a Magic Cube (aka Rubik's Cube) amateur and was fascinated by it for a longer period of time in high school. At the time, the record for the fastest average of five recoveries of a 3rd order Rubik's cube was held by `Feliks Zemdegs`_ (1995--), who broke his own previous world record in 2013 with an average speed of 7.91 seconds. 

Here is a photo of my beloved cube, a Dayan Lingyun (大雁凌云) bought around 2011. It came with me all the way from Hubei to Shanghai to Davis. But I haven't lubed it for a long time and It doesn't rotate pretty smoothly now.

In my personal opinion, there are several stages in the level of amateurs' Rubik's cube by the average solving time：

* *Don't know how to restore*: This is the level of most people in the world.
* *Successful restore is not guaranteed*: Entry-level amateurs who not yet fully master the restore method.
* *In 5 minutes*: You may need a better cube and learn finger skills to help you speed up.
* *In 2 minutes*: You can enter 1 minutes by practice.
* *Around 40 seconds*: You can learn some advanced restoring method, such as CFOP.
* *Around 25 seconds*: This is a bottleneck for capacity enhancement. You need to many new factors (e.g. sharper observation, more advanced top-level restore methods) to go further.
* *Around 15 seconds*: Sub-professional level. I think 12 seconds is probably the ultimate in what the CFOP method can achieve.
* *Less than 12 seconds*: You are no longer an amateur.

My personal best was to achieve an average of around 16 seconds for five restores using the pure CFOP method. My level should be down now, probably staying at an average of 25 seconds. I used to play 4th order cube and can restore it around 2.5 minutes, but now I've forgotten the tricks for 4th order Rubik's Cube.
