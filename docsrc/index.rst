My name is Kanglong Wu, or you can call me by my internet nickname ``wklchris``.

I got my BS degree in Transportation Engineering (with a Mathematics minor) in `Tongji University`_ in Shanghai, China. Now I am a PhD student in Transportation Engineering program of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of California, Davis (`UC Davis`_). 

Although I am not a computer science major, I have been learning programming since I was 10 years old and have always loved it. This is the reason why I am active on Github and have created this personal site.

Last, this website is built on a Sphinx theme that I developed in my spare time, called "Simrofy". You can access its documentation by visiting this sub-page of this website: Simrofy_.
