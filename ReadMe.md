This is the code repository of my personal Github Pages website [wklchris.github.io](https://wklchris.github.io).

* The site is built using a theme I developed in my spare time named [Simrofy](https://github.com/wklchris/sphinx-simrofy-theme), which is based on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
* For the blogs (in Chinese), please visit [Blog repo](https://github.com/wklchris/blog).


## History

In 2017, I built the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you are interested in those earlier codes, please view the commits history of this repo.
